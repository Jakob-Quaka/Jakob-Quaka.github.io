        What makes a hero? A hero is someone who you admire and look up to throughout your life. To some
        a hero is someone that is alive and others it is someone who has passed away. A hero has many redeaming qualities about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hero that I most admire has the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brave - He was able to look death straight on and build something he believed in</li>
        <li>Good Leader - people looked up to him in times of hardship</li>
        <li>Big footprint - started the creation of one of the most influential countries, Great Britain</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - was willing to do anything for his country</li>
        <li>Smart - was able to deceive and outsmart his opponents in battle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since the year 871 till 899 when he died, King Alfred was one of the most influential people on this planet. Without him there
        would be no such thing as the countries we had today since he was the first major person to believe in the idea of Great Britain
        and without that idea we would most likely not be American as of now since Britain would not be established at all. He was a brave
        leader who would do anything for his people and during his reign he was able to fend off multiple Viking invasions.
