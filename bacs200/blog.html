             With the increase in temperature that has been happening around the world it has caused multiple issues when it comes to economic impacts. One of the two major economic issues that come with climate change is the fishing industry. With the increase in water temperature, it has caused the depopulation of some fish and lowered the amount that fisherman can catch which causes issues since they can not sell as much or catch as much. Another major issue is if the rising level of water in the ocean, it can cause some tourist areas to become obsolete and no longer able to operate. This creates isssues for some major places that require tourism as a major indusrty.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pt-2 rounded-top mb-0">
            With the rising tensions between both sides about climate change about it being real or not, it has caused some issues because it makes it harder to pass legislature. As we are gaining more evidence towards it to persuade the side that does not believe as much in it we are able to create new policies to help ourselves out with saving the world.

            As we have seen with the increased issue with Climate Change, we have to be able to adapt how we go about our daily lives by being more considerate towards the planet such as commuting, businesses producing less carbon emissions, and as a whole country learning how to reuse resources.

                In conclusion, we have to realize as a society that we need to do something to protect the beauty of our planet and the places that we go. The responsibility of our government needs to take is to keep a tight leash on businesses and support developers who are trying to create new ways to become environmentally friendly. It is not just the people that need to do work, but also the businesses who need to be help accountable by the government to save our planet form a unjust death.
